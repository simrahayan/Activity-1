Region: The continent or major geographical region the country belongs to (e.g., South America, Asia, Europe).

Literacy Rate (%): The percentage of people aged 15 and above who can read and write.

Internet Access (%): The percentage of the population with access to the internet.

Average Years of Schooling: The average number of years of formal education received by people aged 25 and above.

GDP per Capita (USD): The average income per person in the country, measured in U.S. dollars.

On whole, this dataset highlights the socio-economic disparities across regions and underscores the importance of education and digital access in driving economic growth. Countries with higher literacy, better internet access, and more years of schooling tend to have higher GDP per capita. Such data is valuable for policymakers and researchers aiming to improve development strategies, bridge educational gaps, and promote inclusive digital access worldwide.
